Description: The PoTRA analysis is based on topological ranks of genes in biological pathways. PoTRA can be used to detect pathways involved in disease (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). We use PageRank to measure the relative topological ranks of genes in each biological pathway, then select hub genes for each pathway, and use Fishers Exact test to determine if the number of hub genes in each pathway is altered from normal to cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Alternatively, if the distribution of topological ranks of gene in a pathway is altered between normal and cancer, this pathway might also be involved in cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Hence, we use the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test to detect pathways that have an altered distribution of topological ranks of genes between two phenotypes (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). PoTRA can be used with the KEGG, Biocarta, Reactome, NCI, SMPDB and PharmGKB databases from the devel graphite library.  Most of the approaches for topology-based network and pathway analysis are based on different correlation-based metrics to identify differential networks between two different phenotypes. Generally, there are three main ways to compare networks for differential network analysis. The first approach handles weighted networks and uses some functions of the edge-specific weight differences as edge weights to construct differential networks (Hudson, Reverter & Dalrymple, 2009; Tesson, Breitling & Jansen, 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Rhinn et al., 2013). The second approach tries to find co-expressed gene sets and identify which correlation patterns are different between sets across conditions (Watson, 2006; Rahmatallah, Emmert-Streib & Glazko, 2014). This approach formulates summary measures that represent co-expression in a biological network and compares the metric between sets. The third approach compares the topology of biological networks across different phenotypes by using measures such as degree of nodes or modularity (Reverter et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009). However, the PoTRA method uses a topology-based metric to identify differential networks between two phenotypes. In addition to using different metrics, some of the other tools are based on correlation pattern of genes and identify groups of genes whose correlation patterns behave differentially across different datasets (Watson, 2006; Hudson, Reverter & Dalrymple, 2009; Tesson, Breitling & Jansen, 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Rhinn et al., 2013). Compared to these tools, PoTRA is directly based on topological ranks of genes and aims to identify pathways where the topological ranks of genes are different across datasets, which is more biologically intuitive. In this method, not only do we use correlation networks but we also use combined networks by taking intersected networks of correlation networks and KEGG curated pathways. Hence, when KEGG curated pathway information is employed, the topological rank-based PoTRA method can apply to the combined networks, while the previous correlation-based methods cannot, which is a limitation of the previously discussed correlation-only based methods. Regarding the previous tools based on topology (Reverter et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009), Zhang et al. focuses on identifying genes involved in topological changes, while PoTRA focuses on identifying pathways involved in topological changes. Also, Reverter et al. focuses on identifying genes with differential connectivity between two phenotypes, which is also different from PoTRA's application scenario. Although the above methods for differential network analysis can deal with some important biological questions, they are still limited. In general, they are based on a basic hypothesis that some connections between genes across the groups could be thought of as passenger events and other connections are unique to either one of groups and thus could be driver events that contribute to disease progression and development. Hence, they focus on the contribution of individual differential connections to disease. This results in several limitations. First, each differential connection is regarded by these methods to have an equal contribution to disease. However, it is well understood that loss of a connection between two hub genes from normal to disease is more deleterious than loss of a connection between two non-hub genes. Second, how differential connections (driver connections mentioned above) between pairs of genes are associated with diseases is still not very biologically intuitive, because how the dependency between genes contributes to diseases is usually little understood. To address these problems, we propose a new PageRank-based method called Pathways of Topological Rank Analysis (PoTRA) to detect pathways associated with cancer. PageRank is an algorithm initially used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results (Page et al., 1999). It is a way of measuring the importance of nodes in a network. More generally, PageRank has been applied to other networks, e.g., social networks (Pedroche et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). To date, there have been several studies using PageRank for gene expression and network analysis (Morrison et al., 2005; Winter et al., 2012; Kimmel & Visweswaran, 2013; Hou & Ma, 2014; Bourdakou, Athanasiadis & Spyrou, 2016; Zeng et al., 2016; Ramsahai et al., 2017; Morshed Osmani & Rahman, 2007). These studies focus on ranking genes and discovering key driver genes in disease, and do not try to detect dysregulated pathways involved in disease. Other studies (Winter et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2016) use PageRank to select topological important genes and simply see which pathways that these topological important genes are involved in. These PageRank-related approaches are very different from our approach. Our approach embodied by PoTRA is motivated by the observation that the loss of connectivity is a common topological trait of cancer networks (Anglani et al., 2014), as well as the prior knowledge that a normal biological network includes a small number of well-connected hub nodes and a large number of nodes that are non-hubs (Albert, 2005; Khanin & Wit, 2006; Zhu, Gerstein & Snyder, 2007). However, from normal to cancer, the process of the network losing connectivity might be the process of disrupting the structure of the network, namely, the number of hub genes might be altered in cancer compared to that in normal or the distribution of topological ranks of genes might be altered. Thus, we hypothesize that if the number of hub genes is different in a pathway between normal and cancer, this pathway might be involved in cancer. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to detect pathways involved in cancer by testing if the number of hub genes for each pathway is different between normal and cancer samples.
